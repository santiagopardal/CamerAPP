# CamerAPP

CamerAPP is the web APP designed for [CamerAI](https://github.com/santiagopardal/CamerAI). Built in ReactJS with AntD and Axios.

Although the project has grown a lot, there are still many things to improve, some of which are mentioned in the TODO list below.

## TODO's:

- [ ] Add authentication with JWT.
- [ ] Allow livestreaming for all the cameras.
- [ ] Allow playing videos in the browser instead of just allowing the user to download them.
- [ ] Allow users to add new cameras to the system as well as removing them, the API is ready for both.
- [ ] Fix some bugs that occur when entering responsive mode.
